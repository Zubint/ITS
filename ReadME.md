This project is ultimately going to be a one page website that captures visitors safari desires, and sends them a sample itinerary via email.  The site owner will receive an e-mail with relevant information so that he can contact these potential clients directly.  There will be an admin portal that enables the owner to add and modify itineraries.  Built with:

Bootstrap / Unify template
PHP using Code Ignitor
MySQL

Hosting will be on amazon.com.  Temporary deployment available here:  http://52.39.58.132
